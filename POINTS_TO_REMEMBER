POINTS TO REMEMBER
*******************

Main Components of Snort

A. Packet Decoder - Packet collector component of Snort. It collects and prepares the packets for pre-processing. 
B. Pre-processors - A component that arranges and modifies the packets for the detection engine.
C. Detection Engine - The primary component that process, dissect and analyse the packets by applying the rules. 
D. Logging and Alerting - Log and alert generation component.
E. Outputs and Plugins - Output integration modules (i.e. alerts to syslog/mysql) and additional plugin (rule management detection plugins) support is done with this component. 

3 Types of Rules
================

Community Rules - Free ruleset under the GPLv2. Publicly accessible, no need for registration.
Registered Rules - Free ruleset (requires registration). This ruleset contains subscriber rules with 30 days delay.
Subscriber Rules (Paid) - Paid ruleset (requires subscription). This ruleset is the main ruleset and is updated twice a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays).

Main Files:
snort.conf: Main configuration file.
local.rules: User-generated rules file.

HOW TO CONFIGURE IT?
sudo gedit /etc/snort/snort.conf

1. Navigate to the "Step #1: Set the network variables." section.
TAG_NAME                                    INFO                                    EXAMPLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOME_NET                That is where we are protecting.                         'any' OR '192.168.1.1/24'

EXTERNAL_NET            This field is the external network, so we need to keep   'any' OR '!$HOME_NET' 
                        it as 'any' or '!$HOME_NET'. 
                        
RULE_PATH               Hardcoded rule path.                                      /etc/snort/rules

SO_RULE_PATH            These rules come with registered and subscriber rules.   $RULE_PATH/so_rules

PREPROC_RULE_PATH       These rules come with registered and subscriber rules.    $RULE_PATH/plugin_rules

2. Navigate to the "Step #2: Configure the decoder." section.

In this section, you manage the IPS mode of snort. The single-node installation model IPS model works best with "afpacket" mode. You can enable this mode and run Snort in IPS.

TAG NAME              	INFO	                                                      EXAMPLE

#config daq:            IPS mode selection.                                     afpacket
#config daq_mode:       Activating the inline mode                              inline
#config logdir:         Hardcoded default log path.                             /var/logs/snort

Data Acquisition Modules (DAQ) are specific libraries used for packet I/O, bringing flexibility to process packets. 

There are six DAQ modules available in Snort;

Pcap: Default mode, known as Sniffer mode.
Afpacket: Inline mode, known as IPS mode.
Ipq: Inline mode on Linux by using Netfilter. It replaces the snort_inline patch.  
Nfq: Inline mode on Linux.
Ipfw: Inline on OpenBSD and FreeBSD by using divert sockets, with the pf and ipfw firewalls.
Dump: Testing mode of inline and normalisation.

3. Navigate to the "Step #6: Configure output plugins" section.

This section manages the outputs of the IDS/IPS actions, such as logging and alerting format details. The default action prompts everything in the console application, so configuring this part will help you use the Snort more efficiently. 

4.Navigate to the "Step #7: Customise your ruleset" section.

TAG NAME                          INFO                                                      EXAMPLE

# site specific rules         Hardcoded local and user-generated rules path.    include $RULE_PATH/local.rules
#include $RULE_PATH/          Hardcoded default/downloaded rules path.          include $RULE_PATH/rulename
