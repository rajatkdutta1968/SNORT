Capabilities of Snort are not limited to sniffing and logging the traffic. IDS/IPS mode helps you manage the traffic according to user-defined rules.

(N)IDS/IPS mode depends on the rules and configuration

IDS/IPS Mode
************

NIDS mode parameters are listed:-

Parameter                                               Description

-c                                            Defining the configuration file

-T                                            Testing the configuration file

-N                                            Disable Logging

-D                                            Background Mode

                                              ALERT MODE
                                              full: Full alert mode, providing all possible information about the alert. This one also is the default mode; 
-A                                            fast: Fast mode shows the alert message, timestamp, source and destination IP along with Port numbers.
                                              console: Provides fast analysis alerts on the console screen
                                              cmd:  CMG style, basic header details with payload in hex and text format.
                                              none: Disabling alerting
                                              
NOTE: Once you start running IDS/IPS mode, you need use rules.

Example: The defined rule will only generate alerts in any direction of ICMP packet activity.

alert icmp any any <> any any  (msg: "ICMP Packet Found"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)

This rule is located in "/etc/snort/rules/local.rules".

** Snort will create an "alert" file if the traffic flow triggers an alert. One last note; **

once you start running IPS/IDS mode, the sniffing and logging mode will be semi-passive. However, you can activate the functions using the parameters discussed 
in previous tasks. (-i, -v, -d, -e, -X, -l, -K ASCII) If you don't remember the purpose of these commands.


IDS/IPS mode with parameter "-c and -T"
****************************************

Start the Snort instance and test the configuration file. 

sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -T


IDS/IPS mode with parameter "-N"
*********************************

Start the Snort instance and disable logging by running the following command:

sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -N
