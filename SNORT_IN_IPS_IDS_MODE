Capabilities of Snort are not limited to sniffing and logging the traffic. IDS/IPS mode helps you manage the traffic according to user-defined rules.

(N)IDS/IPS mode depends on the rules and configuration

IDS/IPS Mode
************

NIDS mode parameters are listed:-

Parameter                                               Description

-c                                            Defining the configuration file

-T                                            Testing the configuration file

-N                                            Disable Logging

-D                                            Background Mode

                                              ALERT MODE
                                              full: Full alert mode, providing all possible information about the alert. This one also is the default mode; 
-A                                            fast: Fast mode shows the alert message, timestamp, source and destination IP along with Port numbers.
                                              console: Provides fast analysis alerts on the console screen
                                              cmd:  CMG style, basic header details with payload in hex and text format.
                                              none: Disabling alerting
                                              
NOTE: Once you start running IDS/IPS mode, you need use rules.

Example: The defined rule will only generate alerts in any direction of ICMP packet activity.

alert icmp any any <> any any  (msg: "ICMP Packet Found"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)

This rule is located in "/etc/snort/rules/local.rules".

** Snort will create an "alert" file if the traffic flow triggers an alert. One last note; **

once you start running IPS/IDS mode, the sniffing and logging mode will be semi-passive. However, you can activate the functions using the parameters discussed 
in previous tasks. (-i, -v, -d, -e, -X, -l, -K ASCII) If you don't remember the purpose of these commands.


IDS/IPS mode with parameter "-c and -T"
****************************************

Start the Snort instance and test the configuration file. 

sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -T


IDS/IPS mode with parameter "-N"
*********************************

Start the Snort instance and disable logging by running the following command:

sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -N

IDS/IPS mode with parameter "-D"  (IN BACKGROUND MODE)
*********************************

sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -D

if you activate verbosity (-v) or full packet dump (-X) with packet logger mode (-l) you will still have the logs in the logs folder, but there will be no output
in the console.

to get process ID:
ps -ef | grep snort

TO KILL THE PROCESS:
sudo kill -9 PROCESS_ID

NOTES: Daemon mode in snort is used mainly to automate the Snort. This parameter is mainly used in scripts to start the Snort service in the background. 
It is not recommended to use this mode unless you have a working knowledge of Snort and stable configuration.

IDS/IPS mode with Parameter "-A"
*********************************
(A) sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A console
Console mode provides first style alerts on the console screen. 

(B) sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A cmg

Cmg mode provides basic header details with payload in hex and text format. Start the Snort instance in cmg alert mode (-A cmg ) 

(C) sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A fast
Fast mode provides alert messages, timestamps, and source and destination IP addresses.

(D) sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A full
Full alert mode provides all possible information about the alert. Remember, there is no console output in this mode.

(E) sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A none
Disable alerting. This mode doesn't create the alert file. However, it still logs the traffic and creates a log file in binary dump format. Remember, 
there is no console output in this mode. 

(F) sudo snort -c /etc/snort/rules/local.rules -A console

IDS/IPS mode: "Using rule file without configuration file"
It is possible to run the Snort only with rules without a configuration file. Running the Snort in this mode will help you test the user-created rules. 

****************************************************************
              IPS mode and dropping packets
****************************************************************

sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -q -Q --daq afpacket -i eth0:eth1 -A console

Snort IPS mode activated with -Q --daq afpacket parameters.
You can also activate this mode by editing snort.conf file.
Activate the Data Acquisition (DAQ) modules and use the afpacket module to use snort as an IPS: -i eth0:eth1
