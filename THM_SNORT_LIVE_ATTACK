THM SNORT LIVE ATTACK
1.
write an IPS rule and run Snort in IPS mode to stop the brute-force attack. Once you stop the attack properly, you will have the flag on the desktop!

Here are a few points to remember:

Create the rule and test it with "-A console" mode. 
Use "-A full" mode and the default log path to stop the attack.
Write the correct rule and run the Snort in IPS "-A full" mode.
Block the traffic at least for a minute and then the flag file will appear on your desktop

Ans:
(A) create a rule in /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
